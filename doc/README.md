The new `/monitor` endpoint provides both an HTML dashboard and a JSON API for tooling integration. It auto-updates in the browser and can be scraped by observability agents.

Example JSON (`GET /monitor?json=1`):

```json
{
   "requests": {
      "total": 42,
      "successful": 40,
      "errors": 2,
      "bytes_served": 1048576,
      "uptime_secs": 360
   },
   "downloads": {
      "bytes_served": 1048576
   },
   "uploads": {
      "total_uploads": 5,
      "successful_uploads": 5,
      "failed_uploads": 0,
      "files_uploaded": 7,
      "upload_bytes": 5242880,
      "average_upload_size": 748982,
      "largest_upload": 2097152,
      "concurrent_uploads": 0,

      "success_rate": 100.0
   }
}
```

HTML Dashboard (`GET /monitor`):
- Lightweight embedded template (no external assets) served with caching disabled for freshness
- Auto-refresh JavaScript polling (`?json=1`) to update counters
- Shows cumulative bytes served (downloads) and upload metrics side-by-side

Use cases:
- Local debugging of throughput
- Basic operational visibility without external APM
- Simple integration point for external monitoring (curl + jq / cron)

- Active connection count
- Per-endpoint breakdown & rolling window rates
- Exporter mode (Prometheus/OpenMetrics formatting)

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Improvements**
- **Enhanced Multipart Parser**: Robust RFC-compliant parsing with streaming support
- **Improved Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed requests and resource exhaustion
- **Better Concurrency**: Thread-safe file operations with unique filename generation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The codebase features a **modular template architecture** with clear separation of concerns. Core modules include `server.rs` for the custom thread-pool listener, `http.rs` for request parsing and static asset serving, `upload.rs` for secure file upload handling, `multipart.rs` for RFC-compliant multipart parsing, `search.rs` and `ultra_compact_search.rs` for the dual-mode search system, `templates.rs` for the native template engine, `fs.rs` for directory operations, and `response.rs` for file streaming and error handling. The `templates/` directory contains organized HTML/CSS/JS assets for directory listing, uploads, and search interfaces.

## üß™ Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

The project includes **179 comprehensive tests across 16 test files** covering all aspects of functionality, with complete upload system validation:

```bash
# Run all tests (covers upload, download, security, concurrency)
cargo test

# Run with detailed output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test suites
cargo test comprehensive_test    # Core server functionality (19 tests)
cargo test integration_test      # Authentication & security (6 tests)  
cargo test upload_integration_test # Upload functionality (29 tests)
cargo test debug_upload_test     # Multipart parser (7 tests)
```

### Test Architecture

**Custom HTTP Client**: Tests use a native HTTP client implementation (zero external dependencies) that directly connects via `TcpStream` to verify:

- **Bidirectional File Operations**: Upload and download functionality with unlimited size support
- **Multipart Processing**: RFC-compliant parsing with boundary detection and validation
- **Template System**: Modular HTML/CSS/JS serving for both download and upload interfaces
- **Security Validation**: Input sanitization, boundary verification, extension filtering
- **Concurrency Handling**: Multiple simultaneous uploads with thread safety
- **Error Scenarios**: Malformed data rejection, resource exhaustion protection
- **Authentication**: Secure upload/download with basic auth integration
- **HTTP Compliance**: Headers, status codes, and protocol adherence across all endpoints

### Test Coverage

| Test Category | Count | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **Upload System** | 29 | Single/multi-file uploads, unlimited size support, concurrency, validation |
| **Core Server** | 19 | Directory listing, error pages, security, authentication |
| **Multipart Parser** | 7 | Boundary detection, content extraction, validation |
| **Security** | 12+ | Authentication, rate limiting, path traversal, input validation |
| **File Operations** | 15+ | Downloads, uploads, MIME detection, atomic operations |
| **Monitoring** | 8+ | Health checks, statistics, performance tracking |
| **UI & Templates** | 10+ | Upload/download interfaces, error pages, responsive design |

Tests start the server on random ports and issue real HTTP requests to verify both functionality and integration.
